Pascal is one of the older programming languages that are used today. Older in this context means, that it was initially developed in 1969 by Dr. Niklaus Wirth on the ETH Zurich. Despite the fact, that it is older than 40(!) years, the language has greatly involved in the last decades. All of the features that are required by a modern programming language are supported by Pascal, too.<!--more-->

Pascal was standardized as an ISO standard in the early 90s. Unlike other languages, there were different Pascal dialects and compilers since the beginning.[^1] Today there are two major implementations: **Delphi™** and **Free Pascal**.

Delphi™ is a Rapid Application Development (RAD) environment, which consists of the Object Pascal language, a powerful and fast compiler, a large runtime-library (RTL) and a designer for Graphical User Interfaces (GUI). Delphi™ runs on Windows but can compile programs for GNU/Linux, MacOS, Windows, iOS and Android.

[Free Pascal](http://www.freepascal.org) is a free, Open Source implementation of the Object Pascal language. It consists of the language, the compiler and also a runtime-library - but does not include the RAD-tools which made Delphi™ famous. But thanks to some Free Pascal enthusiasts, the [Lazarus IDE](http://www.lazarus-ide.org) was developed as a powerful RAD environment for Free Pascal. Both, Free Pascal *and* Lazarus, are highly cross-platform and can run on different systems, among them are GNU/Linux, Windows, MacOS, BSD.
